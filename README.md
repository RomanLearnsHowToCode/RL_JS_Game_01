! New project.. more information is comming soon

LOG: 16/01/2022

GENERAL:
- first part of tutorial is done, tomorrow (17/01/2022) I would like to go through the code, comment stuff, rename some variables and fix responsiveness of game

- ASSETS: 
- ogg assets differ in size, they might be optimised
- png images of fish are 4x bigger than they could be, I could simply resize and rewrite the variables in js script, I could enhance performance like this

- GAME LOOP:
- some ideas how to improve they game are: add lifes, add different types of fishes (you could choose fish based on amount of lives and speed as an example), existing SCORE could be bound to a name value and parsed as JSON to database, there could be menu for this game which could show scoreboard with corresponding name and score values.
